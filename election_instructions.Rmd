This is an analysis of the 2014 mayoral elections. After the dataset of the election outcome was released several people tweeted about voter irregularities. The discussion picked up after a post by [erenyanik](https://twitter.com/emeyersson/status/450978793746743298).

[erenyanik](https://twitter.com/emeyersson/status/450978793746743298) shows a plot of the AKP-CHP voter share versus turnout rate. The graph shows that AKP claims the majority of the irregular votes while loosing the regular vote. 


In our project we explore the data, reproduce some of the results already published and add new insights gained from the data. 


1. Explore the data. Create bar plots and scatter plots. 
2. Recreate this [graph](https://twitter.com/emeyersson/status/450978793746743298)
3. Geodesics: Create a map of how the AKP and CHP votes are distributed
4. Conclusion
